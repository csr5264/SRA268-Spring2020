With this obviously this graph will have an upward trend since this is a ranking from the lowest to highest. The information that stood out on this graph is that besides 2 outliers most of the seasons and teams won by a similar amount of points. There wasn't a season where a team or many teams absolutly dominated other teams. This makes sense due to the teams basically being professional, however it is nice to see that in a visualized graph."
